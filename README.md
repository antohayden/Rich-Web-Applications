# Rich Web Applications Project

		
## Overview
This was a project done during my 4th year of my Computer Science Degree course.

It uses the [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library to visualize data retrieved from a previously built [JSON RESTful API](https://github.com/antohayden/Enterprise-applications) in different forms. 
The framework for the application is built upon [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).
